## Credits/Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Brackeys (https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) for creating the "How to make a Tower Defense Game (E01) - Unity Tutorial", which I followed closely to mimic the coding style and how to properly use Unity Engine.

I would also like to thank Brackeys for providing starting assets (3D Models and Sprites) for this tutorial and more (https://devassets.com/browse/).
Assets I used in this Unity game include Tower Defense Assets, Military Vehicles, Desert Environment, Mayan Temple.

Usage of these assets strictly follow the guidelines as shown on https://devassets.com/guidelines/.
